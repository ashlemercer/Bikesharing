# Bikesharing Challenge


## Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

In this Deliverable 1, we took our Bikesharing CSV and used Pandas to convert the Trip Duration to a datetime datatype, as seen below in the second-to-last line under "New_TripDuration". The second photo shows the new Tripduration in its new format.

## Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

In this deliverable, we created 5 different charts that displayed the following:

### 1. A line graph displaying the number of bikes checked out by duration for all users, and the graph can be filtered by the hour.

### 2.  A line graph displaying the number of bikes that are checked out by duration for each gender by the hour, and the graph can be filtered by the hour and gender.

### 3. A heatmap is created showing the number of bike trips for each hour of each day of the week.

### 4. A heatmap is created showing the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week, and the heatmap can be filtered by gender.

### 5. A heatmap is created showing the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week, and you can only filter by user and gender.

  ## Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

# Story 1

Link to Tableau Story 1 of 2

https://public.tableau.com/shared/5XHQN2YT5?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

In our first story, I have established in the first page the most popular Starting Locations for Citibikes, with a majority of them being located next to popular subway stations, as well as popular points of interest in Manhattan. This would mean that we would prove successful in putting bike stations closer to subway stations for commuters getting off of their trains and onto their next location.

<img width="831" alt="Popular Starting Locations" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103979087/185204797-f44fe2ed-b38c-46a8-b24e-f6cf4162827c.png">

In the second photo of the story, we see the most popular times for renting bikes, which are at 5pm and 8am. This would be the best times to have bikes fully stocked near those hotspots highlighted above.

# Second Story

In my second story, I have organized the worksheets from Deliverable 2 into a seemless story that ties into the Peak August Hours worksheet seen above. 

I chose to go with the heatmap of Trips by Gender/Weekday/Hour to show what days exactly are most popular at those peak times, which the data shows is on Thursdays between 5 and 6, primarily by Male users.

<img width="1049" alt="Story Peak Times" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103979087/185207094-123f4b5b-b07e-4937-aac2-5856025e66b4.png">


To go a little futher I show a breakdown of the Usertypes by Gender and Day of the week, which shows that Male Subscribers on Thursdays are the biggest clients.

And lastly, I highlight the Trip duration by Genders. The data shows that a significant amount of the trips are 5 minute commutes made by male users.

# Analysis

From this data, we have concluded that Males, and more specifically, Male Subscribers, make up the majority of the clientelle. Mostly for short, 5 minutes commutes, and most closely to subway stations, which seems to be users getting off subways and hopping on a bike to get to their next destination at a quicker pace than walking.

We would be most successful in putting more bike stations near subway stations and parks for commuters.
