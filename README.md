# Bikesharing Challenge


## Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

In this Deliverable 1, we took our Bikesharing CSV and used Pandas to convert the Trip Duration to a datetime datatype, as seen below in the second-to-last line under "New_TripDuration".

## Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

In this deliverable, we created 5 different charts that displayed the following:

### 1. A line graph displaying the number of bikes checked out by duration for all users, and the graph can be filtered by the hour.
